Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u00a0 If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.\u00a0 Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.<\/p><p><strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.<\/strong>\u00a0If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and\/or based solely on written submissions;
